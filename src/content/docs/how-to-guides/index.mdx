## These Are Task-Oriented

You have a specific goal. These guides show you how to do it.

No theory. No explanations. Just "here's the command, here's what happens."

## Coming Soon

We're building out practical guides for:

**Core Workflows:**
- Compile a single function
- Compile your entire project
- Test generated code
- Save checkpoints for production
- Check for spec drift

**HTTP Endpoints:**
- Create a FastAPI endpoint with `@vibesafe.http`
- Freeze HTTP dependencies
- Mount generated endpoints to your app

**CI/CD Integration:**
- Set up GitHub Actions
- Add drift detection to CI
- Auto-generate in CI (if you must)

**Advanced:**
- Use multiple providers (OpenAI + Claude + local)
- Custom prompt templates
- Property-based testing with Hypothesis
- Debugging failed generations

## For Now
